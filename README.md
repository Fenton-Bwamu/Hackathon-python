1. Searching Algorithms.
task 1:Ternary Search: Implement a Python ternary search for finding a specific element in a sorted array. This algorithm should be efficient.
task 2:Search in Rotated Sorted Array: Design an algorithm that efficiently locates a specified target value within
 an array that has been sorted in ascending order and then rotated at an unknown pivot point.

2. Advanced String Manipulation
task 1:Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Write a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
task 2:Regular Expression Matching: Implement a function that supports regular expression matching with support for . and *.

3. Sorting Algorithms
task 1:Custom Sort: Write a function that sorts a list of dictionaries based on a specified key.
task 2:Kth Largest Element: Develop an algorithm to find the Kth largest element in an unsorted list.
